                <h3>Some developing asteroids called Mimos have been reported to have collided with the well established World Congress of WeAreDevelopers.
                    The damages caused by the impact have been divers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>a minor black hole has been created that attracted and swallowed other developers like Julia, Christos, Damian or Obay. At some point even strangers like the tripped guy joining us on our first dinner at the Syrian restaurant Aldimashqi.
                    </h4></li>
                    <li><h4>the impact caused some chemical reactions that ignited some explosive emotions specially when meeting famous stars like HÃ¥kon Wium Lie  - creator of CSS -, Bjarne Stroustrup -creator of C++ or Joel Spolsky - founder of stackoverflow.com. All of this emotions culminating with the common photo session with John Romero, the creator of the first ego-shooter game Wolfenstein.
                    </h4></li>
                    <li><h4>the impact caused also Mimos colliding with:
                        <ul>
                    <li> > each other some already known from the screen but some completely new from other cohorts.</li>
                    <li> > with members from different other universes, who might swallow the Mimos in the future. In the end all Mimos expanded in size not only from Basil's wonderful 'sous vide' dinner and Syrian dishes but also in knowledge, experiences and new friends.</li>
                    </ul></h4></li>
                </ul>
